Telecommunications networks design and location-allocation problems can be often represented by the Ring Star Problem (RSP). RSP is an optimization problem aiming to create a ring-star connecting subgraph, minimizing the sum of the ring costs of the cycle and the assignment costs of the vertices. This paper extends this problem to the Capacitated Ring Star Problem (CRSP) variation and presents a branch-and-cut algorithm to solve this problem. Initially, an overview of the background of the CRSP is provided, including related problems in literature. The branch-and-cut algorithm is introduced, highlighting its main components: the developed CRSP model and the generated cutting planes, serving as bounds for the problem. Using a CPLEX Solver in Python, the algorithm is constructed and tested across different instances for various vertex sets sizes and different costs. The computational experiments include metrics to measure the performance of the model. The findings demonstrate that the branch-and-cut algorithm delivers better outcomes for smaller set sizes, and contribute into finding the areas for further improvement of the model.
