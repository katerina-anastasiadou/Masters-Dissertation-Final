**A Branch-and-Cut Algorithm for the Capacitated Ring-Star Problem**

Telecommunications network design and location-allocation problems can be often represented by the Ring Star Problem (RSP). RSP is an optimization problem aiming to create a ring-star connecting subgraph, minimizing the sum of the ring costs of the cycle and the assignment costs of the vertices. This paper extends the problem to the Capacitated Ring Star Problem (CRSP) and presents a branch-and-cut algorithm to address it. Initially, an overview of the CRSP background is provided, including related problems in the literature. The branch-and-cut algorithm is introduced, highlighting its main components: the developed CRSP model and the generated cutting planes, serving as bounds for the problem. Using a CPLEX Solver in Python, the algorithm is constructed and tested across different instances for various vertex set sizes and different costs. The computational experiments include metrics to evaluate the performance of the model. The findings demonstrate that the branch-and-cut algorithm delivers better outcomes for smaller set sizes, and contributes to finding the areas for further improvement of the model.
